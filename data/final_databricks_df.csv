`context.create_expectation_suite()` creates an empty expectation suite that you can later populate with expectations.

`profiler.build_suite()` executes a profiler against your data to build an expectation suite pre-populated with some basic expectations related to your data.

`context.build_data_docs()` builds your Data Docs (html reports on your data validations) from your previously executed validations.

`validator.save_expectation_suite()` saves the  expectation suite actively being build with your validator, so that you may later pass that suite into a checkpoint for validation.",2023-03-10 20:10:04,1,2023-03-09 23:13:48,1

Thanks for reaching out. It looks like you may be trying to navigate your docs from within a jupyter notebook.

Navigating within an iPython HTML object can be particularly fragile; we would recommend either opening the exact validation result you'd like to see, or opening your docs within a browser if possible.

If this is supported by your environment, you may be able to run:

I have a problem in the execution stage of Great Expectation and I would like your help for this.

In summary, through conda, I performed the installation process that is on the tool's page ( <https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/guides/setup/installation/local/> ). I managed to complete everything as expected in this installation process, however, when I tried to run the Quickstart tutorial ( <https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/tutorials/quickstart/> ), I started to receive the following error message:

TypeError: Instance and class checks can only be used with @runtime_checkable protocols

It occurs when I try to connect to the "".csv"" file, in the following code snippet:

validator = context.sources.pandas_default.read_csv(
     ""<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/great-expectations/gx_tutorials/main/data/yellow_tripdata_sample_2019-01.csv>""
)

Anyway, I've looked for several alternatives and none have answered me so far. Has anyone experienced this and would know how to resolve it?

I'm grateful in advance!

Batch requests identify a specific set of data, which may include multiple assets, or may be a subset of a single asset, depending on configuration.

Your interaction with them depends on your workflow -- utilizing fluent datasources reduces the need to interact with batch requests, but they are still occasionally needed.

When working with block-config datasources, batch requests are generally required to identify that specific sub-or-superset of your data to be utilized .",2023-05-11 17:52:06,1,2023-05-11 12:41:41,1

Any readings and documentation would be very much appreciated!",2023-05-17 14:05:22,True,,,,CUTCNHN82,channel,967e05b0-952f-4bd8-bc02-d1f3cbfd2b21,,,1684332322.002139,,,,,,,,,,,T7NEH00BA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-05-24 16:29:50,U02GD1EL2AJ,170.40777777777777,False,,False,,,,,CUTCNHN82,channel,967e05b0-952f-4bd8-bc02-d1f3cbfd2b21,,,1684332322.002139,,,,,,,,,,,T7NEH00BA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CUTCNHN82,gx-community-support,1684332322.002139,U04SR7MSG4A:CUTCNHN82:1684333100.075929,U04SR7MSG4A,Clark Mckenzie,True,True,"hi Dylan, I’ve achieved this in the past with a custom query expectation <https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/guides/expectations/creating_custom_expectations/how_to_create_custom_query_expectations> you can follow an existing queried expectation at the GX repo to use as a template. an SQL statement underlies QueryExpectations so if you have existing SQL that could be leveraged.",2023-05-17 14:18:20,1,2023-05-17 14:05:22,1

Topic: custom expectations.
We have been using custom expectations for a while now, but we wanted to enforce usage of result_format complete with unexpected_index_column_names. So, in addition to validate the success result of the test examples, we also wanted to validate the ""unexpected_index_list"" presence and if it matches the expected values.

Just to clarify, is your `great_expectations.yml` located at:

`/app/prefect-airbyte/great_expectations/great_expectations.yml`

or

`/app/great_expectations/great_expectations.yml` ?

This is the error that surfaces when there is no valid `great_expectations.yml` provided for some reason, e.g. no `great_expectations` directory where this code is being executed, the path to a directory isn't provided or there is no `great_expectations` directory located there, and a key is provided which precludes generating an InMemory context.

In this case, if your `great_expectations` directory is at `/app/prefect-airbyte/great_expectations`, I would try:

```context = gx.get_context(context_root_dir=""/app/great_expectations/"")```
Specifying `context_root_dir` is important here; pointing directly to the `yml`, or not providing the appropriate argument name, will prevent this from working.",2023-04-28 17:08:12,1,2023-04-28 11:46:08,1

Getting started
Let's jump into it then!

import great_expectations as ge
First we'll need a DataContext. This represents a Great Expectations project, holding all your configurations, expectation suites, data sources and so on. We'll have a better look at the data context later [Data Context], but just to get started we shipped a simple one with this tutorial.

We'll load that one right now. By default, Great Expectations will look for your configuration in the great_expectations directory.

context = ge.data_context.DataContext()
Now that we have our DataContext ready, we can add an expectation suite. Think of this like a test suite, but for your data instead of for your code. Usually you'll do this through the CLI, but we will get to that later [The Great Expectations CLI]. We'll name the suite check_avocado_data.

suite = context.create_expectation_suite(
    'check_avocado_data',
    overwrite_existing=True
)
Next, we load our dataset, avocado.csv, from our data context. This involves a bit of configuration, but don't worry about it too much for now. We'll get back to that later [Data Context].

batch_kwargs = {
    'path': 'data/avocado.csv',
    'datasource': 'data_dir',
    'data_asset_name': 'avocado',
    'reader_method': 'read_csv',
    'reader_options': {
        'index_col': 0,
    
}
batch = context.get_batch(batch_kwargs, suite)

In the above code instead of local data I am trying to add azure blob storage for which iam following below code

datasource_config = {
    ""name"": ""my_azure_datasource"",
    ""class_name"": ""Datasource"",
    ""execution_engine"": {

Currently, Custom Expectations within the plugins directory are only registered once:

1. Your context has been instantiated, and
2. You have imported the expectation.
If you are, for example, running a script which executes a checkpoint containing a custom expectation, you will still need to import that expectation within that script, to ensure that it is able to be run.

I am trying to retrieve datatypes for my database using GX, as I do not know the datatypes themselves.
I tried expect_column_values_to_be_of_type, but that does not really return the datatype of the columns I'm searching.
In addition, I was hoping to be able to achieve that on a table level, so as to avoid having to run the expectation too many times.
Is there any recommendation as to what expectations I can use that you are able to provide? Or if there is anyway I can improve the usage of expect_column_values_to_be_of_type?

2. the percentage change/difference between the means/medians of two columns, so ideally something like `expect_column_pair_means_difference_to_be_between`.
However we are not sure if we shall use `ColumnAggregateMetricProvider` or `ColumnPairMapMetricProvider` , or we have to create metric provider and expectation family by ourselves.

If so, we do not yet have “an easy” way to do it — you would have to follow the pattern used for `great_expectations/expectations/core/expect_column_kl_divergence_to_be_less_than.py` but implement the logic for two columns in the aggregate sense, such as in the existing single-column aggregate metrics.  It is on our roadmap to develop a ColumnPairAggregateMetricProvide, but I cannot give a timeline at this point.  In short, whenever a metric deals with a statistic over all rows, that would be “Aggregate”.  If the metric compares the value in a given row to some value, then it is “Map”.  If you need the result quickly, I believe that your idea about a new column that reflects the information from ColumnA and ColumnB combined — and use the ColumnMean metric/expectation then it is a very good approach.

Thanks for reaching out. Bear with me; this is going to be a lot of text!

To your first bullet point, that is exactly correct; the metric specified under `metric_dependencies` is utilized to execute your query, the results of which are then made available to your `_validate` method.

To your second bullet, calling `run_diagnostics()` on that expectation will allow you to inspect the results:

```diagnostics = ExpectQueriedColumnValuesToExistInSecondTableColumn().run_diagnostics()

print([x for x in diagnostics[""tests""]])
print([x for x in diagnostics[""errors""]])```
To your third bullet, when you define `success_keys`,  the items in the tuple are the names of the parameters *which are available for you to use during the evaluation of your Custom Expectation*. Defining `success_keys` is what makes those specific parameters available. Likewise, `domain_keys` are utilized to help define the domain on which your expectation will operate, and specifying those keys makes those parameters available, while allowing for an explicit separation of their function relative to success keys. Take a look at <https://greatexpectations.io/blog/pass-custom-parameters-in-custom-expectations-and-optimize-your-gx-workflows|this blog post> detailing a bit more about these keys, and what can / should be passed here.

We then optionally set default values for these keys, allowing for default customization of your expectation reducing the amount of parameters that *need* to be provided at runtime. In the case of QueryExpectations, explicitly setting a default query here allows the expectation to be utilized with that default query, or *optionally* provide a different query.

By the time we get to the `_validate` method, *all* of our keys have been defined (either by default or at runtime), and are all available via `configuration` for reference within that method. The delineation between success &amp; domain keys is necessary to both to help expectations be self-documenting, and to enable functionality within the actual metric computation running your query.

To your fourth bullet, that doc is correct. When utilizing Custom Expectations, they must be imported after instantiating your Data Context. Many users will create import methods for particular use-cases that can be called within their workflows to minimize overhead on making these imports.",2023-04-27 20:22:18,1,2023-04-27 12:07:16,1

I am currently covering these cases by generating an dummy Dataframe with one row as data if no data was retrieved by my batch request. This leads to every expectation failing, which points us in the right direction.
The problem is only that the validation process takes MUCH longer for this one-row dataframe as opposed to my normal bigger daily data. This slows down later processes in the pipeline and should be avoided, but not generating any ata leads to a Valuerror when trying to  get batches.

Thanks for reaching out.

Typically, a batch request points to a single asset. When utilizing the OnboardingDataAssistant, it is possible to configure multi-batch requests that do what you're describing.

It's also possible to pass a list of Validations to a checkpoint, where each entry in the list is a paring of a batch request point to an asset, and an expectation suite to validate that asset. In this way, it is possible for a single Checkpoint to validate many assets against one or more expectation suites at once.",2023-04-21 18:24:59,1,2023-04-20 20:56:40,1

I'm a newcomer to GX and the GX community. I'm currently exploring the use of Great Expectations for enforcing data quality and validation standards in our datalake.

I'm curious to know if GX can handle scenarios involving data partitioned in a multi-level folder hierarchy on Azure blob store, where each *path containing a file has its unique schema.* In this case, I want to *obtain the schema information* from a separate file and then utilize it to validate and perform various tests on the data file in terms of completeness, *schema checks*, data type etc.

For example:

The folder structure for the *data files* appears as follows:

/_TravelDestinations/continent=Europe/country=Italy/cuisine.parquet_
_/TravelDestinations/continent=SouthAmerica/country=Mexico/cuisine.parquet_
_/TravelDestinations/continent=Asia/country=India/cuisine.parquet_
_/TravelDestinations/continent=Asia/country=Japan/cuisine.parquet_

The folder structure for the *metadata/schema files* appears as follows:

_/TravelDestinations/continent=Europe/country=Italy/schema.parquet_
_/TravelDestinations/continent=SouthAmerica/country=Mexico/schema.parquet_
_/TravelDestinations/continent=Asia/country=India/schema.parquet_
_/TravelDestinations/continent=Asia/country=Japan/schema.parquet_


Here is an example of how the content of the data and schema files may look like:",2023-06-27

Garcia Saez,True,True,"Hi <@U05F19E18Q0>, if I had to work with this sample config I would do something like:

```# read a schema file using pandas
italian_schema_df = pd.read_parquet('/TravelDestinations/continent=Europe/country=Italy/schema.parquet')

# Extract the names form the schema file (gets Pizza, Pasta, etc. as a series), then convert to a list
italian_schema_items = italian_schema_df['name'].tolist()

# Import Great Expectations
import great_expectations as ge

# Setup the environment
context = gx.get_context()

validator = context.sources.pandas_default.read_parquet('/TravelDestinations/continent=Europe/country=Italy/cuisine.parquet')

# Add an expectation to the validator
validator.expect_table_columns_to_match_set(italian_schema_items)

# Validate your data and visualize the results
checkpoint = context.add_or_update_checkpoint(
    name=""my_quickstart_checkpoint"",
    validator=validator,
)

checkpoint_result = checkpoint.run()

context.view_validation_result(checkpoint_result)```
This will output a nice html file with a report that shows the results of checking the columns in the cuisine parquet file agains the names in the schema.

Ot course you could iterate over the structure to get this done over all datasets.

I hope it helps!",2023-06-27 01:42:10,1,2023-06-27 01:16:31,1

Thanks for flagging.

The following code should help you from instantiating a datasource through to getting a validator:

```import great_expectations as gx
context = gx.get_context(context_root_dir=&lt;YOUR_ROOT_DIR&gt;)

dataframe_datasource = context.sources.add_or_update_spark(
    name=""my_spark_in_memory_datasource"",
)

dataframe_asset = dataframe_datasource.add_dataframe_asset(
    name=""my_asset"",
    dataframe=&lt;YOUR_SPARK_DF&gt;,
)

batch_request = dataframe_asset.build_batch_request()

expectation_suite_name = ""insert_your_expectation_suite_name_here""
context.add_or_update_expectation_suite(expectation_suite_name=expectation_suite_name)
validator = context.get_validator(
    batch_request=batch_request,
    expectation_suite_name=expectation_suite_name,
)```
We'll review this gap and address as needed. :bow:",2023-07-25 17:14:33,1,2023-07-25 14:48:36,1
